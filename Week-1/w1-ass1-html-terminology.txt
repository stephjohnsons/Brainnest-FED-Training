HTML elements can have attributes, which provides additional information about elements. 
Attributes are usually included in opening tags with name/value pairs,

23.	What attribute tells links where to go? 
<a href> is the attribute that tells links where to go. href is short for hyperlink reference. 

24.	What is the difference between an absolute and relative link? 
An absolute link is an absolute hyperlink that is available on the worldwide web. 
Such links are usually external websites that are hosted on different servers. 
A relative link is shorter and directs the link to a webpage that is hosted on the same server 
(in any level of directories, whether higher or lower) as the current webpage. 

25.	Which element is used to display an image? 
<img>. This element is an empty element, so a closing tag is not needed. 

26.	What two attributes do images always need to have? 
The two attributes are <img src> and <img alt>. 
The <img src> points out the source of the image, 
and <img alt> allows users to see the description of the image when 
the person is (1) using a screen reader, or (2) unable to see the image.

27.	How do you access a parent directory in a file path? 
By using“../” in file paths, I can access files from a parent directory (the folder one level up from the current folder).
